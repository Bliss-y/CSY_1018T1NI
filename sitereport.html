					<h1>Site Report</h1>
					<h2 class="headings">Abstract</h2>
					<p class="contents">
						I am Nishedh Karki, a student of Northampton University. This
						website is my submission for the College Assessment Assignment given
						By the Northampton University. The goal was to create a responsive
						website to show my portfolio and CV. There are 5 pages:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="index.html"> Home </a></li>
						<li><a href="portfolio.html"> Portfolio </a></li>
						<li><a href="contact.html"> Contact </a></li>
						<li><a href="cv.html"> CV </a></li>
						<li><a href="#"> Site Report (This Page) </a></li>
					</ol>
					<p class="contents">
						This is the final report of the website with all details of it's
						creation as well as my personal logs. The report shows not only the
						development of the website but also my personal growth as a
						developer. It includes different challenges and obstacles
						encountered during the development of the website.
					</p>
					<h2 class="headings">Objectives</h2>
					<p class="contents"></p>
					<ol>
						<li>To Test My HTML and CSS skills.</li>
						<li>To Create a functional and well-designed website.</li>
						<li>To get knowledge about fundamentals of building websites.</li>
						<li>To get knowledge about the webpages and how they work.</li>
						<li>To learn Git and make optimal use of it's function.</li>

					<h2 class="headings">Module: CSY1018 WEB 1</h2>
					<p class="contents">
						My journey in the module 'WEB1' has been very exciting. In the
						beginning, I was not really sold by the career of web development as
						I was interested more in Software Engineering. This module, however,
						made me realize the beauty of web development and rethink my plan.
						"Just HTML and CSS is too less", I used to think but as the module
						progressed I realised how much I had yet to learn. Learning github
						was another great experience for me. I can now confidently say that
						i've grown a lot. I look forward to the next term.
					</p>
					<h2 class="headings">Creating the Website</h2>
					<p class="contents">
						When I got the assignment, in May 12, I was very nervous and
						doubtful in my abilities as a developer. But as I started building
						the website I definitely beccame more confident in myself. <br />
						<br />
						The first thing I was thinking about while creating the website was
						the layout and theme. It was very difficult to come up with a good
						design so I decided to just start the basic menu and go with
						whatever came. Needless to say, I had an idea to create a sci-fi
						themed website. Hence, I started to research and saw some sfi-fi
						works like "star wars" and "rick and morty" to get a grasp of the
						mood and colors for the website. Hence, I created some glowing neon
						effects on everything with Blue colored theme. I used Box-Shadow
						property on CSS to create the glowing border on the Nav bar and Menu
						items. I planned out the layout but not the content at all. Later
						that day i decided to use some red to complement the Cyan and
						changed the text color to cyan. Also due to bright background the
						"Glow" was getting undermined, so I decided to use Deep Blue for the
						background gradient instead. The hover effect was also added to the
						menu to make it brighter while hovered. Then an idea of creating the
						big sections of the pages to float around as if they're in space
						popped in my head. I worked on the animation using @keyframes. I
						also decided to make change on the code design so that the
						redundancy of repeating the Box-shadow property was removed. Instead
						of giving box-shadow property to every elements(nav bar, home page
						container etc), I created a new class glowBorder and glowShadow with
						the properties. A new 'Curr' class was also added to the menu item
						of the current page. The curr class was given a bouncing animation
						using @keyframes, and background color was made bright.<br /><br />
						Although the initial theme for the website was sci-fi, half way
						through the development i Issued a major change to it by taking it
						to a whole different direction which is the final design for the
						website. The theme now is gray-scaled. The change was made because I
						suddenly felt that I overdid with the design on the previous ones.
						It was also very difficult to manage, due to fixed box-shadow size
						the site looked hideous in mobile. Also, The "formal" contents like
						CV didn't fit the sci-fi environment I had created for the website.
						With the gird display everything fell on place. The code was very
						manageable, easy to debug and also very clean. There was no problem
						with the content. The website was mobile-friendly right away.<br /><br />
						At the very end of the project I found out about the main tag to
						enclose all my contents inside. It was definitely a surprise to
						findout about it from freeCodeCamp when i was practising some more
						web developing. I decided to go with grey-scaled as it is a modern
						term. All the websites these days have dark mode. So I went with
						something along that line.
						<a href="https://discord.com/">Discord app</a> was the website I was
						inspired by. The layout is created using grid-display to make it
						more adaptive towards responsive design.<br /><br />
						I definitely learned a lot during this project aside from just html
						and css but also about design. The following log will show the
						journey of creating this page and my personal takes.

							<strong>
								A HUGE DESIGN DECISION: Goodbye shiny borders and text.-
							</strong>
							I changed my website theme to 'grey-scaled' from the 'glowing
							sci-fi'-theme.
							<br /><br />
							Display: grid in website layout was implemented for better
							resposiveness. The webpage is divided into three mail parts:
							<ul>
								<li>The Header</li>
								<li>Menu Bar/ Nav Bar</li>
								<li>Content Container</li>
							</ul>
							The dream of sidebar menu still lives on!!
